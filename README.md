## ðŸ“‹ Project Summary

âš« **1. Skewing Image**

This project displays the various changing of an image like: **rotating**, **translation**, 
**scaling** and **transforming**.

The core idea:
- Rotate an image without any damaging.
- Translate an image in direction you intend.
- Scale an image in smaller form or bigger form.
- Transform an image in 2 ways, affine transform and perspective transform.

âš« **2. Applying Filter**

This project applies filter on an image in several ways to remove noise and detect the edge so that 
the image become more clear.

The core idea:
- Make an image in blur using average filter kernel so that understand about blurring.
- Apply gaussian blurring on an image to remove noise.
- Detect the edge from the image that be removed noise through applying cv2.Canny function.
